# Advent of Code Golf 2023

![Advent of Code Golf icon](./advent-of-code-golf.png)

This is a community project for Advent of Code Golf 2023 - anyone can submit a
solution to any day, in any language (supported by [Attempt This
Online](https://ato.pxeger.com)), and the shortest one for each language wins.
This file will be maintained by the `solution-bot` and will contain the current
leaderboard.

If you wish to submit solutions, please use [the bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1179753478214651915&permissions=0&scope=bot)

## Submission rules

- Each solution must be a full program, runnable on [Attempt This
  Online](https://ato.pxeger.com) -  this is how the bot will evaluate submissions.
- Each solution must be a valid answer to the challenge - the bot will check this
  against my input/output for the day. If you believe a submission is *wrong*
  (i.e. doesn't solve the challenge on your input), please raise an issue
  including the submission, your input, and the expected answer.
- Puzzles involving grid lettering do not need to OCR the letters themselves -
  outputting the grid is sufficient.
- Input will be provided as stdin, and output should be to stdout.
- Input length is measured in *bytes*, not characters.
