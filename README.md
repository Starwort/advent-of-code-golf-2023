# Advent of Golf 2023

This is a community project for Advent of Golf 2023 - anyone can submit a solution to any day, in any language (supported by [TIO.run](https://tio.run)), and the shortest one for each language wins. This file will be maintained by the `solution-bot` and will contain the current leaderboard.

## Submission rules

- Each solution must be a full program, runnable on [TIO.run](https://tio.run) - this is how the bot will evaluate submissions.
- Each solution must be a valid answer to the challenge - the bot will check this against my input/output for the day. If you believe a submission is *wrong* (i.e. doesn't solve the challenge on your input), please raise an issue including the submission, your input, and the expected answer.
- Puzzles involving grid lettering do not need to OCR the letters themselves - outputting the grid is sufficient.
- Input will be provided as stdin, and output should be to stdout.
- Input length is measured in *bytes*, not characters.
